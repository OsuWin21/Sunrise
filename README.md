# ðŸŒ… Sunrise - osu! private server

Sunrise is a private server for osu! written in C#. This repository has both endpoints for game-client and for the website. The server is currently in development and is not yet ready for public use.

> [!NOTE]
> Why C#? Well, because owner of this project has allergies to non-typed languages. Sad, I know.

## Installation ðŸ“©

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or any other IDE)
3. Run the project
4. (Optional) Forward osu! traffic to your local server using a tool like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
